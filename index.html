								<p><span class="boldText">CONTEXT: </span>Technology Exchange Lab is an NGO focused on creating a curated database of "solutions to problems of poverty." They put together a mobile app development team with the goal of making their database available to more people in more places. As we put together a user profile and fleshed out our user requirements, we quickly realized a few things. First, the application needed to function in even in remote areas without connectivity. Second, the app's user interface needed to be clear and simple to ensure that even those with little prior experience with technology could successfully navigate.</p>
								<p><span class="boldText">RESULTS: </span>The project was a success! After coming to an agreement on the application design, we developed an Android app, currently available on the Google Play Store. Next steps in this project include the development of an iOS app and a new design iteration following more user research.</p>

								<p><span class="boldText">CONTEXT: </span>The Kio Kit is a digital classroom by BRCK that has been deployed successfully in over 10 countries. BRCK wanted to implement a new user account system and gave me the task of developing a preliminary information architecture and user interface for displaying statistics surrouding Kio Kit Usage. I began by identifying key user groups, and after identifying 6 user groups who would need different statistics displays (students, teachers, school administrators, content providers, BRCK employees, and government officials) quickly realized that this was quite an extensive project. My next step was to interview users that fell into my identified categories in order to determine the needs of each user group. Finally, I created a preliminary information architecture, and developed a set of wireframes based on what I had learned.</p>
								<p><span class="boldText">RESULTS: </span>Given the complex nature of this project, my job was just to come up with a preliminary set of designs. Once finished, I passed these designs along to BRCK's UX lead who continued to iterate on the information I had gathered and the interface I'd designed. I feel that this project was a great success given how much I was able to learn during my work, as well as subsequent conversations with those who were responsible for iterating on my work.</p>

Through user research we discovered that, when we told BRCK.org's story clearly and concisely through text, images, and video, people felt more connected to the organization and their mission statement.</p>
								<p><span class="boldText">RESULTS: </span>While our solution has not yet been implemented, it has been approved by the design team at BRCK.org, and will be implemented over the next 6 months as time permits.</p>
